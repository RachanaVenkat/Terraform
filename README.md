# first-terraform-project
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, networks, storage, and more using a declarative configuration language. Terraform enables you to manage and orchestrate infrastructure across various cloud providers, as well as on-premises environments, in a consistent and efficient manner.

This project utilizes Terraform to define and provision an EC2 instance on AWS. It provides a structured and repeatable approach to managing AWS resources, allowing for automated infrastructure deployment and maintaining consistency across environments.

Execution Commands: To apply your Terraform configuration and create the EC2 instance, you use Terraform commands such as terraform init (to initialize the project and download necessary plugins), terraform plan (to preview changes), and terraform apply (to apply the changes and create resources). After applying the changes, Terraform will output the values defined in your outputs.tf file.
